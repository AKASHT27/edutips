                        <p class="skills__text">Psychometric tests help teens and individuals identify acquired skills and talents inside them, thereby deciding which career path to take while they move forward in their studies. The test further helps individuals to make their life-changing decisions appropriately rather than just being swept off by the latest trends.

                            Psychometric tests are the scientific ways used to explore a student’s attitude, skills, and interests to assess their personality. The purpose of conducting a psychometric test is to gauge the personality type, behavioural traits, and capacities of the students with the age of 14 and above. The psychometric test serves as great insight for companies to hire the right candidate. This is done through a meticulously drafted questionnaire that covers the Eight Multiple Intelligences. All of these when put together help to get an understanding of the individual’s aptitudes in various streams according to their interests.</p>

Picking a career usually comes after picking a course. If they do not pick the right course, it would inadvertently affect their career choice. In such a case, a psychometric test is more helpful in determining the interests based on personalities and capabilities. The decision-making control shifts from peer pressure to the student.
